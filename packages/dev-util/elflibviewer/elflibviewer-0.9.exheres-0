SUMMARY="ELF Library Viewer lists what libraries a given program or shared library links to"
DESCRIPTION="
shows a list of libraries that a given application or library depends on. This is done recursively
depends on. This is done recursively as well, so instead of the flat list given by tools like
ldd(1), you can tell what libraries are depended upon directly, and indirectly. You could use this
to determine what library is causing link errors for your application, for instance.
