These issues should probably be addressed before we merge to master:

- Fix multibuild of phonon[qt5]
- Add an snapshot of polkit-qt taken from its qt5 branch...
- ...and let kauth[policykit] depend on it. Note that it doesn't check for the
  Qt4 version and compiles fine with it but things will propably go horribly
  wrong during runtime. Note: currently kauth[policykit] is hard-disabled.
- Fix remaining collision upstream (kactvities, kio and kde4support)

A litte bit unrelated:
- Sort out all issues with Qt5 and unmask it (or at least not as broken anymore)
