These issues should probably be addressed before we merge to master:

- Find out why Qt5Gui_PRIVATE_INCLUDE_DIRS doesn't provide the right path
  and remove the horrible hacks in kguiaddons and frameworkintegration
- Fix multibuild of phonon[qt5]
- Add an snapshot of polkit-qt taken from its qt5 branch...
- ...and let kauth[policykit] depend on it. Note that it doesn't check for the
  Qt4 version and compiles fine with it but things will propably go horribly
  wrong during runtime.
- Rename everything properly to our liking, e.g. plasma <-> plasma-framework
- Possibly move packages to kde-frameworks, candidates are attica and
  extra-cmake-modules for example.
- Fix remaining collision upstream (kactvities, kio and kde4support)

A litt bittle unrelated:
- Sort out all issues with Qt5 and unmask it (or at least not as broken anymore)
