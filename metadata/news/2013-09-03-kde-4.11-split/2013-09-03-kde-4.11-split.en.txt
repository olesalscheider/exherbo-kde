KDE 4.11.x has four packages additionally split compared to KDE 4.10.x
  - kde/kdeadmin
  - kde/kdenetwork
  - kde/kdesdk
  - kde/kdetoys

The easiest way to handle this is:

1) Upgrade KDE normally ignoring those four packages:
  cave resolve kde-split

2) Check which kde_parts were enabled for those four monolithic packages:
  cave show kde/kdeadmin kde/kdenetwork kde/kdesdk kde/kdetoys

3) Get the list of newly available split packages:
  cave show kdeadmin-split\* kdenetwork-split\* kdesdk-split\* kdetoys-split\*

4) Manually install the split packages you want by comparing the
above lists and permitting uninstall of the blocked packages, e.g.:
  cave resolve --permit-uninstall kde/kdeadmin \
               ksystemlog \
               --permit-uninstall kde/kdenetwork \
	           kopete kget \
               --permit-uninstall kde/kdesdk \
               lokalize okteta umbrello \
               --permit-uninstall kde/kdetyos \
               kteatime

Packages from those sets that get installed without being added to world will
become part of the kde-split set which you probably want in world.

Note that some of the split packages are named
"<monolithic_package_name>-<kde_parts>" like kdenetwork-filesharing or
kdesdk-thumbnailers. Furthermore kmtrace, kstartperf and kuiviewer were
combined into kde-dev-utils.

scripts was renamed to kde-dev-scripts which we don't package at the moment.
Feel free to package it if you need it.
