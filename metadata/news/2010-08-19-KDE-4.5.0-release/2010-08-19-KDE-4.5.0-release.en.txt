KDE 4.5.0 has been released. This release does not include KDEPIM since
upstream wants to test it further before unleashing it on users.

Instead they fully support using KDEPIM 4.4 with KDE 4.5.0.

So if you use KDEPIM you should upgrade by using:

  cave resolve kde --with kdepim-runtime --with kdepim
