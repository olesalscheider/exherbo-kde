The sets for KDE and Qt5 packages were previously named with a -split
suffix. Now this suffix was dropped, for example kdegraphics-split
was renamed to kdegraphics. You can install all packages of a set
with:

# cave resolve <set>\*

As a reminder you can find all renamed sets
below (as well as in the sets/ directory of the ::kde repo):

kde
kdeaccessibility
kdeadmin
kdebindings
kdeedu
kdegames
kdegraphics
kdemultimedia
kdenetwork
kdesdk
kdetoys
kdeutils
qt5
