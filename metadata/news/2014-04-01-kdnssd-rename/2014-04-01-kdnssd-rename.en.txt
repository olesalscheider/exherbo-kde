Please install kde/zeroconf-ioslave and *afterwards* uninstall kde/kdnssd.

1. Take note of any packages depending on kde/kdnssd
cave resolve \!kde/kdnssd

2. Install kde/zeroconf-ioslave:
cave resolve kde/zeroconf-ioslave -x

3. Re-install the packages from step 1.

4. Uninstall kde/kdnssd
cave resolve \!kde/kdnssd -x

Do it in *this* order or you'll potentially *break* your system.

NOTE: kde-frameworks/kdnssd:5 isn't affected. It's a different piece of
software and in fact provided the reason its KDE4 namesake was renamed.
