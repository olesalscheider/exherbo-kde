KDE 4.8.2 has two packages additionally split compared to KDE 4.7.4:
  - kde/kdeaccessibility
  - kde/kdeutils

The easiest way to handle this is:

1) Upgrade KDE normally ignoring those two packages:
  cave resolve kde-split

2) Check which kde_parts were enabled for those two packages:
  cave show kde/kdeaccessibility kde/kdeutils

3) Get the list of newly available split packages:
  cave show 'kdeaccessibility-split*' 'kdeutils-split*'

4) Manually install the split packages you want by comparing the
above lists and permitting uninstall of the blocked packages, e.g.:
  cave resolve --permit-uninstall kde/kdeaccessibility \
               kmag \
               --permit-uninstall kde/kdeutils \
	       ark filelight kgpg kwallet

If you are still on KDE 4.6.x or older consult the exherbo-dev mailing list on
split kde 4.7 unmasking instead.
